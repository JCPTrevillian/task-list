# task-list

**This Task List is a helpful project that I created for how I organized my process for completing sprint tickets. 
When a task is accomplished, I click the related box and a green checkmark appears so I can see my progress 
and know what actionable step to take next. It also helped me know what to share during daily stand up.**
